# 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different
# ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person
# is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are
# between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are
# over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which
# you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
# of their movie ticket.
