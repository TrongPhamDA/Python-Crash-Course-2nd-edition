# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from
# Exercise 9-1 (page 162). Add an attribute called
# number_served with a default value of 0. Create
# an instance called restaurant from this class.
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has
# served, and then change this value and print it again.
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you
# set the number of customers that have been served.
# Call this method with a new number and print the
# value again.
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that
# lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve
# been served. Call this method with any number you like
# that could represent how many customers were served in,
# say, a day of business.
