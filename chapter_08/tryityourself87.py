# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that
# builds a dictionary describing a music album. The
# function should take in an artist name and an album
# title, and it should return a dictionary containing
# these two pieces of information. Use the function
# to make three dictionaries representing different
# albums. Print each return value to show that the
# dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.

# Use None to add an optional parameter
# to make_album() that allows you to store the number
# of songs on an album. If the calling line includes
# a value for the number of songs, add that value to
# the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function
# call that includes the number of songs on an album.
