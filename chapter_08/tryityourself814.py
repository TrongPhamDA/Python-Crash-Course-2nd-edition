# 8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about
# a car in a dictionary. The function should always receive
# a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an
# arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
# with the required information and two other name-value
# pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your
# function should work for a call like this one:
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue',
#     tow_package=True)
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all
# the information was stored correctly.

print("\nEx 8.14 Cars\n" + "-"*70)
